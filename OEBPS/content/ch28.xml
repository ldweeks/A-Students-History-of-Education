<h2>Chapter 28 - Retrospect and Prospect</h2>
<p><strong>Outline</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Evolution in education may be interpreted from the standpoint of the development of individualism. Individualism was first fully recognized in the teachings of Christ, but was repressed during the Middle Ages. While it reappeared during the Renaissance, Reformation, and other movements, it soon lapsed, but a complete break from tradition occurred with Rousseau in the eighteenth century.</li>
<li>For a time individualism dominated, but education since then has endeavored to afford latitude to the individual without losing sight of the welfare of society.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Development of Individualism. - The discussion of present day tendencies that has just been given, together with the account of educational evolution in the preceding chapters, serves to show how far modern times have progressed in the ideals and practice of education. This may perhaps be best appreciated from the standpoint of the development of individualism. To follow such an interpretation back to the beginning of the history of education, it may be stated that during the day of primitive man no real distinction was made between ^^^MHltic society and the individual, and practically all advance- tendencies</p>
<p>&#8226;" 1 during the days</p>
<p>ment was impossible, for no one looked much beyond of primitive the present. With the appearance of the transitional period in the Oriental countries, the individual had begun nations,</p>






<p>Roman civili zations,</p>


<p>Christian de velopment,</p>


<p>to emerge, but was kept in constant subjection to the social whole, for man was quite enslaved to the past.</p>
<p>Athenian and ^<sup>s</sup> <sup>tne</sup> J<sup>ew</sup>ish; Athenian, and Roman civilizations developed, the beginnings of individualism were for the first time clearly revealed, and some regard was had for the future. Then, through the teachings of Christ, there came to be a larger recognition of the principle of individualism and the brotherhood of man. Owing to a necessity for spreading these enlarged ideals among a barbarous horde of peoples, individualism was repressed,</p>
<p><em>TM<sup>d</sup>J<sup>he</sup> </em><sup>Middle</sup> and throughout the Middle Ages the keynote was submission to authority and preparation for the life to come. The cultural products of Greece and Rome largely disappeared, and all civilization became restricted, fixed, and formal.</p>
<p>But the human spirit could not be forever held in bondage, and, after almost a millennium of repression and uniformity, various factors that had accumulated within the Middle Ages produced an intellectual awakening that we know as the 'Renaissance.' Its vitality lasted during the fifteenth century in Italy and to the close of the sixteenth in the Northern countries, but by the dawn of the seventeenth century it had everywhere degenerated into a dry and mechanical study of the classics. This constituted a formalism almost as dense as that it had superseded, except that linguistic and literary studies had replaced dialectic and theology. A little later than the spread of the Renaissance, though overlapping it somewhat, came the allied movement of the 'Reformation.' This grew in part out of the disposition of the Northern Renaissance to turn to social and moral account the revived intelligence and learning. Yet here
also the revival failed in its mission, and the tendency to</p>


<p>the Renaissance,</p>
<p>the Reformation,</p>






<p>rely upon reason rather than dogma hardened into</p>
<p>formalism and a distrust of individualism. Again, in</p>
<p>the seventeenth century, apparently as an outgrowth of</p>
<p>the same forces, intellectual activity took the form of a</p>
<p>search for 'real things.' The movement that culminated</p>
<p>in 'sense realism' appeared, but this small and crude <sup>and</sup> <sup>realism</sup>;</p>
<p>beginning of the modern scientific tendency was for some</p>
<p>decades yet held within limits. Associated with this</p>
<p>realistic tendency, on the religious and political sides</p>
<p>also appeared a quickening in such forms as 'Puritanism'</p>
<p>and 'Pietism,' which likewise degenerated eventually into tanism and</p>
<p><em>e </em>,. . j 1 . Pietism;</p>
<p>a fanaticism and hypocrisy.</p>
<p>The Harmonization of the Individual and Society. -  Thus the way was opened for the complete break with JUJJj ^&#176;<sup>u</sup>||f<sup>au</sup> tradition and authority that occurred in the eight- "trudge</p>
<p><em><sup>J</sup> <sub>m</sub> </em>&#176; tendency.</p>
<p>eenth century. This tendency, while in France at least most destructive and costly, was the inevitable result of the unwillingness to reshape society and education in accordance with changing ideals and conditions. Hence Rousseau undertook to shatter all educational traditions. But his recommendation of isolated education, so palpable in its fallacies, prepared the ground for the numerous social, scientific, and psychological tendencies (see pp. 218-222) that were destined to spring up in modern education and for the consequent improvement in the aim, organization, content, and method of education. Of course modern education has advanced infinitely beyond anything implied by Rousseau or even the later reformers of the past century, but it is out of his attempts at destruction that has grown this nobler structure. For a time individualism triumphed and</p>






<p>The present</p>


<p>ground authority under its heel, but when this extremity had been passed, the problem became how to harmonize the individual with society, and to develop personality progressively in keeping with its environment. Thus the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have put forth conscious efforts to justify the eighteenth and to bring out and develop the positions barely hinted at in its tendencies in negations. It is not alone the individual as such that</p>
<p>education .</p>
<p>seemtohar- has been of interest in the modern period, but more and dividual more the individual in relation to the social whole to</p>
<p>tho^ofsodety. which he belongs, as only in this way can the value of his activities be estimated.</p>
<p>This is revealed in the works of those who followed</p>
<p>Rousseau, and especially in the attempts of recent</p>
<p>, , . . educational philosophers to frame a definition of educa</p>
<p>Recent defim- .</p>
<p>tions of educa- tion that shall recognize the importance of affording</p>
<p>tion show this. , . , , ...... .... . , , ,</p>
<p>latitude to the individual without losing sight of the welfare of the social environment in connection with which his efforts are to function. Thus Butler, though recognizing the individual factor, especially stresses the social by declaring education to be "the gradual adjustment of the individual to the spiritual possessions of the race." Then he further declares: "When we hear it sometimes said, 'All education must start from the child,' we must add, 'Yes, and lead into human civilization;' and when it is said on the other hand that 'all education must start from a traditional past,' we must add, 'Yes, and be adapted to the child.'" And the balance between the two factors of the individual and society is even more explicitly preserved in Dewey's statement "that the psychological and social sides are organically related, and that education cannot be regarded as a compromise between the two, or a superimposition of one upon the other." In the same way Bagley has made 'social efficiency' the main aim in educating the individual to-day, and both elements are carefully considered by all modern writers in discussing educational values. Thus the central problem in education of the twentieth and succeeding centuries is to be a constant reorganization of the curriculum and methods Jona^probiem of teaching, and this reconstruction must be such as to <sup>of</sup> <sup>the</sup> <sup>future</sup>harmonize a due regard for the progressive variations of the individual with the welfare of the conservative institutions of society. It must include a continual effort to hand on the intellectual possessions of the race, but also to stimulate all individuals to add some modification or new element to the product. In this way there may develop unending possibilities for both the individual and society.</p>

<p><em>Cloth, i2mo, $1.10. </em></p>
<p>Striking characteristics of the book will be found in the emphasis laid upon educational institutions and practices, rather than upon theoretical development; and in the larger place given to American education. The account of each educational movement has included at least an attempt to trace its influence upon the content, method, and organization of education in this country, while three chapters have been devoted exclusively to the rise of our educational system. The book is intended primarily for use in the United States, and will be of service to our teachers largely as it succeeds in focusing the educational progress of this country. It will be quite possible, however, for those readers in England and other countries to neglect or curtail these parts of the book, and still have a body of material sufficient to represent satisfactorily the history of education during the past two centuries.</p>
<p>"One of the notable studies in educational history."</p>
<p> - <em>Journal of Education. </em></p>
<p>"The book is well proportioned and well written. . . . Very clear and helpful. . . ." - <em>Educational Review. </em></p>
<p>"A model of scientific exposition." - <em>The Nation </em>(London).</p>
<p>"Of great service to all who are interested in the theory and practice of education in Europe and America, from Rousseau to our own day."</p>

<p>dle Ages and the Transition to Modern Times</p>
<p>By FRANK PIERREPONT GRAVES, Ph.d. Professor of the History of Education in the University of Pennsylvania</p>
<p><em>Cloth, I2PW, $1.10 </em></p>
<p>This volume is a continuation of the "History of Education before the Middle Ages." Without dwelling upon matters remotely related to the educational problems of to-day, an accurate picture is afforded of educational history between the sixth and the eighteenth centuries. The sources are extensively quoted, and selected lists of supplementary reading are given at the end of each chapter. The book is suitable as a text or a work of reference.</p>
<p>"In the same spirit of careful research and open-minded discussion that marked the first part of his work." - <em>The Independent. </em></p>
<p>"The present volume is not only as good as, but better than, the previous one. The work is conspicuous among histories of education as one of the most complete and interesting."</p>
<p> - <em>Journal of Educational Psychology. </em></p>
<p>"He has made of dry historical facts a narrative full of interest, one that touches the life, politics, religion, and philosophy of the times."</p>
<p> - <em>Pedagogical Seminary. </em></p>
<p>"Clear and concise, Professor Graves's work merits praise as an excellent piece of text-book writing. The need for such a book has been keenly felt by the teacher of educational history." - <em>School Review. </em></p>
<p>"A very interesting text and covers the ground thoroughly."</p>
<p> - <em>Western Journal of Education. </em></p>
<p>"Professor Graves takes up the history of educational processes and ideals during this period in a very clear and illuminating way."</p>
<p> - <em>Charles A. Ellwood in The American Journal of Sociology. </em></p>

<p>By FRANK PIERREPONT GRAVES, Ph.d. Professor of the History of Education in the University of Pennsylvania</p>
<p><em>Cloth, i2tno, $1.10 </em></p>
<p>This book gives a comprehensive account of the history of education before the day of the monastic schools. It presents sufficient material to mark the most significant movements and discloses the underlying principles without entering into unnecessary detail. All interpretations are based upon historical data collected from the sources, and direct quotation is liberally used throughout.</p>
<p>"Professor Graves has taken the method of procedure, at once most natural and most philosophical, of studying each stage with a view to progress." - <em>The Outlook. </em></p>
<p>"A book which gives evidence on every page of ripe scholarship, breadth of view, and keen discrimination between significant things and mere detail." - <em>The School Review. </em></p>
<p>"Professor Graves does well to give the profession the fruit of his abundant knowledge in a scholarly text-book and reference work, complete without being tedious, condensed without being lifeless." - <em>Journal of Education. </em></p>

<p><em>Cloth, i2tno, $1.10 </em></p>
<p>This book furnishes a popular account of the life and work of the men who, during the past three centuries, have introduced various innovations and reforms into modern education. While the facts of biography are narrated somewhat at length, an effort has been made to eliminate everything that does not have some bearing upon the contributions of the educator under consideration.</p>
<p>"As history is largely a matter of biography, and as institutions are usually the lengthened shadow of a man, so the historic trend of education can be indicated well enough for the casual reader by an intelligent summary of the work of a few great educators together with comments on the tendencies and interrelations of that work. Professor Graves has gotten up such a summary in his brief volume, in which he has judiciously selected and clearly stated his facts. His comments on these facts are illuminative and his comments would seem to be well founded." - <em>Boston Evening Transcript. </em></p>
<p>"The thoroughly painstaking method of Professor Graves is evident on every page of these splendidly written books. A scientific and scholarly attitude combined with common-sense makes these by all odds the most practical text-books yet published in this field." - President W. G. Clippinger, of Otterbein University.</p>
<p>"The social settings, dialectic methods, and ultimate achievements of nearly a score of illustrious world reformers are here brilliantly outlined." - <em>The Philadelphia North American. </em></p>
